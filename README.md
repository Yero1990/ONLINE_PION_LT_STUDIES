## ONLINE PION-LT STUDIES
This repository contains the relevant scripts used for setting up the initial parameters and calibrations for optimum results during the online data-taking period of the PION-LT Experiment at Hall C.

### Directory Structure:<br>
> NOTE: For the purpose of keeping this repository clean, the ROOTfiles containinig the ntuples (directly from the hallc_replay as well as those containng the histogram objects are placed in a .gitignore file to prevent them from being pushed or pulled remotely from github.
