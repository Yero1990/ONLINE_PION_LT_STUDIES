Pion LT 2021 Raster
====================

On 09/20/2021, there was an issue with raster coil magnets --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3909088
which resulted in Fast Raster "A" Magnet Coils (X,Y) being turned OFF, and doubling the current through
"B" Magnet Coils (X,Y)

The relevant to the Fast Raster Raw ADC signal parameters need to be updated for this new raster configuration.
The calibration parameters for the Fast Raster, located in PARAM/GEN/gbeam.param

Following the changes in the fast raster hardware,
the The Carbon-Hole Run 12272 ---> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3909107

The relevant ROOTvariables for setting the Fast Raster parameters are:
--------------------------
H(P).rb.raster.frxbRawAdc
H(P).rb.raster.frybRawAdc
--------------------------

These are raw ADC histograms (ADC signal comed from the X,Y coils), in units of Channels.
The ADC-per-centimeter and offset parameters are determined from the edge values of the abovementioned histograms.

----------
ANALYSIS
----------

The raw min/max ADC Channels from the histograms are:

FR-XB:
-------
min_frXB_RawAdc = 31,448 Channels
max_frXB_RawAdc = 77,552 Channels

FR-YB:
------
min_frYB_RawAdc = 32,631 Channels
max_frYB_RawAdc = 77,132 Channels


"adcpercm" and "_offset" parameters in gbeam.param are determined as follows:

-----------------------------------
gfrxb_adcpercm = (max_frXB_RawAdc - min_frXB_RawAdc) / raster_size (cm)
gfryb_adcpercm = -(max_frYB_RawAdc - min_frYB_RawAdc) / raster_size (cm)  (NOTE: the "-" sign necessary for proper HCANA interpretation)


gfrxb_adc_zero_offset = (max_frXB_RawAdc + min_frXB_RawAdc) / 2.  (NOTE: this is an average and "2" in the denominator is NOT the raster size)
gfryb_adc_zero_offset = (max_frYB_RawAdc + min_frYB_RawAdc) / 2.
-----------------------------------

Inserting the numerical values into the formulas above, for a raster size of (0.4 x 0.4 cm):

gfrxb_adcpercm = ( 77552 - 31448 ) / 0.4  = 115260.0
gfryb_adcpercm = -( 77132 - 32631 ) / 0.4 = -111252.5

gfrxb_adc_zero_offset = ( 77552 + 31448 ) / 2. = 54500.000
gfryb_adc_zero_offset = ( 77132 + 32631 ) / 2. = 54881.500

RESULTS

The results of the Carbon Hole Check are shown below, for the "Before" (left) and After (right) updating the gbeam.param
with the relevant parameters determined above, for run 12272.
