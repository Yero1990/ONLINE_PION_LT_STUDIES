MOTIVATION
-----------

On 09/20/2021, there was an issue with one of the Hall C Fast Raster Coil Magnets --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3909088
which resulted in Fast Raster "A" (FR-A) Magnet Coils (X,Y) being turned OFF, and doubling the current through
Fast Raster "B" (FR-B) Magnet Coils (X,Y), in order to maintain the 2x2 mm raster size.

The relevant Fast Raster Raw ADC signal parameters need to be updated for this new raster configuration.
The calibration parameters for the Fast Raster are located in hallc_replay/PARAM/GEN/gbeam.param 

Following the changes in the fast raster hardware, the Carbon-Hole run 12272 ---> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3909107
was used to determine the new paramters FR-B raster parameters

----------
ANALYSIS
----------

The relevant ROOT Leaf variables for setting the FR-B parameters are:
--------------------------
H(P).rb.raster.frxbRawAdc
H(P).rb.raster.frybRawAdc
--------------------------

These are raw ADC histograms, where the ADC signal comes from the X,Y coils, in units of channels.
The ADC-per-centimeter and offset parameters are determined from the edge values of the abovementioned histograms.
See the histograms below.

The edges (raw min/max ADC Channels) from the FR-B histograms of run 12271 are (also see 1D histograms below):

FR-XB:
-------
min_frXB_RawAdc = 31,448 Channels
max_frXB_RawAdc = 77,552 Channels

FR-YB:
------
min_frYB_RawAdc = 32,631 Channels
max_frYB_RawAdc = 77,132 Channels



The "adcpercm" and "_offset" parameters in gbeam.param are determined as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

gfrxb_adcpercm = (max_frXB_RawAdc - min_frXB_RawAdc) / raster_size (cm)
gfryb_adcpercm = -(max_frYB_RawAdc - min_frYB_RawAdc) / raster_size (cm)  (NOTE: the "-" sign necessary for proper HCANA interpretation)


gfrxb_adc_zero_offset = (max_frXB_RawAdc + min_frXB_RawAdc) / 2.  (NOTE: this is an average and "2" in the denominator is NOT the raster size)
gfryb_adc_zero_offset = (max_frYB_RawAdc + min_frYB_RawAdc) / 2.


Inserting the numerical values into the formulas above, for a raster size of (0.2 x 0.2 cm):

gfrxb_adcpercm = ( 77552 - 31448 ) / 0.2  = 115260.0
gfryb_adcpercm = -( 77132 - 32631 ) / 0.2 = -111252.5

gfrxb_adc_zero_offset = ( 77552 + 31448 ) / 2. = 54500.000
gfryb_adc_zero_offset = ( 77132 + 32631 ) / 2. = 54881.500

ATTACHMENTS
-----------
Attached is the update gbeam.txt file (must change .txt to .param), which should be updated in the ONLINE PION-LT ANALYSIS on CDAQ.

--------
RESULTS
--------
The raw ADC FR-XB and FR-YB 1D histograms are shown below, indicating the edges (estimated by "eye") used to determine the FR-B parameters.
The results of the Carbon Hole Check are also shown below, "Before" and "After" updating the gbeam.param

After updating the gbeam.param, the ONLINE 50k replays should show the correct raster range ~( -0.1 to 0.1 cm for both the X and Y axes) for FR-B
Since FR-A magnets are OFF, do not expect to see anything (maybe only a "dot-like" structure) in the plots
