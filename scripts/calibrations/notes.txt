SHMS DC calibrations look OFF in run 12288 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3909865

Since when do the SHMS calibrations look OFF?

The HMS remain stable. The only change i could think of is the SHMS polarity from negative (during heep singles)
to positive (for production).

The relevant runs to study the bad SHMS DC calibrations found by Nathan

** These replayed runs have been using the DC calibration parameters from de-focused run 11799, calibrated with e- in both arms

changed LH2 --> Al.dummy

Run 12259 (SHMS pos polarity, HMS neg polarity, fADC deadtime studies) --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3908826 (shms dc look OK)

changed Al. dummy ---> LH2 

=============================
Started New Kinemstics @ LH2: shms_theta = 15.43 deg, shms_p = 2.8 GeV/c, hms_theta = 16.7 deg, hms_p = -1.026
