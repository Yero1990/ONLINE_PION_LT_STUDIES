Detector Calibration Stability Checks for H(e, e'p) Singles for PION-LT

------------
STUDY
------------

I looked at the first few H(e, e'p) Singles data taken since the owl shift to determine how stable are
the detector calibrations  during these runs.  

---------------------
PROCEDURE
---------------------

For each characteristic detector calibration plot, the various H(e,'p) singles runs were overlayed
to determine whether there were any strange behavior for any particular kinematic analyzed.
I used the most recent detector calibrations from each detector, including the recent calorimeter
calibration posted by Jacob Murphy ---> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906044

The list of runs analyzed were:

Run 12079 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906446
Run 12080 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906449
Run 12084 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906522
Run 12086 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906542
Run 12090 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906575
Run 12092 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906592
Run 12094 --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906627

OBSERVATIONS
-------------------------

Some important key points to mention:

*********************************
IMPORTANT KEY POINT 1
*********************************
I noticed a weird structure on the SHMS Hodoscopes Beta plot as well as some of the Noble and Heavy Gas Cherenkovs NPE histograms
for run 12080 (shaded black).  According to log-entry --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906456
CODA had a end-of-run failure for this particular run so I decided to look at an adjacent H(e,'p) singles run for this particular kinematic.
The only available RUN was 12079, which was labeled as JUNK according to --> https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3906419
presumably because it only had ~ 6000 events, but I went ahead and looked at it anyways. 

The weird structure remained even for run 12079, although with much worse statistics.  Im not sure what to make of this observation.
It may simply be due to the kinematic region, for which is possible that it was in a region in which the PMTs are not well calibrated for SHMS hodoscopes.

*********************************
IMPORTANT KEY POINT 2
*********************************
For HMS Cherenkov:  I noticed that the number of photoelectrons (NPE) in PMT 2 peaks at around 10-15 (cut out of the plot), whereas 
the number of photoelectrons in PMT 1 has a peak at 0.5, with subsequent smaller peaks.  It may be because it has not been calibrated yet???

For SHMS Noble Gas Cherenkov,  I noticed the NPE gradually becomes larger (shifts right) as one goes from PMT 1 --> PMT 4
Although the single PE peak is at 1, the average number of NPEs varies as shown below.

For the SHMS Heavy Gas Cherenkov, the avg. NPE varies as well for each PMT.

RESULTS
----------------

Below are selected calibration plots for each detector. I've only selected a single plane of the drift chambers, as there
would be too many plots to show.  All the histograms have been normalized to unity for a direct comparison.

Apart from runs 12079, 12080 mentioned above,  Hodoscopes, Calorimeters and Drift Chamber detectors calibrations 
plots look OK and appear to be  stable for the selected runs analyzed.
